## Introduction

**Description**

This is a page where I will documents and track all my learnings from several different fields of study.

## About Me

**Background**

I am graduated from **California State University, Fullerton** with a _Bachelors_ in _Mechanical Engineer_ where my first engineering job was in the pcb _(print circuit board)_ manufacturing industry. From there I moved to Rivian where I began go to experience the mix of hardware + software.
