## Introduction

***Description***

This is a page where I will documents and track all my learnings from several different fields of study.

## About Me

***Background***

I graduated from ***California State University, Fullerton*** with a ***Bachelors*** in ***Mechanical Engineer*** where my first engineering job was in the pcb _(print circuit board)_ manufacturing industry. From there, I moved to Rivian where I was introduced to ECUs _(Electronic Control Modules)_ and how the functionality between hardware, software and connectivity. I primarily worked on the ECU that was in charged of connectivity. Since the system required the knowledge of how to navigating via linux and network protocols. I began to learn start the journal of understanding these concepts in a deeper level. The way I grasp concepts is by learning from the ground up starting with theory and going into practical.

This repository is a one stop shop to all the topics that I have learn so I can refer back to the information as needed. I enjoy learning new concepts and building upon the foundation. I hope to further increase my knowledge and soon get a role within embedded software, software systems, or software related role.
