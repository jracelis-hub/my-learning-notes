## Introduction

**Description**

This is a page where I will documents and track all my learnings from several different fields of study.

## About Me

**Background**

I graduated from **California State University, Fullerton** with a _Bachelors_ in _Mechanical Engineer_ where my first engineering job was in the pcb _(print circuit board)_ manufacturing industry. From there, I moved to Rivian where I began to learning more integration of hardware + software. I was intrugied by the software side of things, which made me pursue a deeper learning outside of work. Here I centralized area where I can keep all my notes in once spot while challenging myself with new topics.
