# Make

## Format

A make file consist of 3 main parameters(rules):

1. Target - the name of the file that needs to be generated by a program (executable or object files)
2. Prerequistites - a file that is used as a input to create the target.
3. Recipe - the action the `make` carries out. This can be more than one command either on the same line or on its own. 

> [!NOTE] 
> The recipe needs a `\t` `tab` at the beginning of each recipe

Example:
```
target: prerequistites ...
	recipe <-- Notice this has a tab
```

When running `make` it will build the very first target listed in the make file by convention. 

```
Makefile
# This is a make file

all: program main

program: program.o
	gcc program -o program

main: main.o
	gcc main.o -o main	

main.o: main.c
	gcc -c main.c

program.o: program.c
	gcc -c program.c

$ make
gcc -c program.c
gcc -c main.c
gcc main.o -o main
gcc program.o -o program

$ ls 
main.o program.o program main
```

But lets just say you just want to make just program, instead of typing `make` do:
