# IMPORTANT NOTES

This are scripts that I automated to make my life easier as I start working in a linux environment.

To proper utilize these scripts do the following to set up your working environment:
```
vim "$HOME"/.bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/.bin":PATH
mv <my.name-of-script> "$HOME/.bin"
```

After be sure to restart the terminal to refresh the changes made in the `.bashrc`.
