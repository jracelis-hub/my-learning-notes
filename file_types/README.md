# JavaScript Object Notation

## Introduction

JSON or JavaScript Object Notation it is a light weight human readable format to store data and exchange data. 
It uses the idea of key value pairs to match a `key` to a `value`. 

The key could be any type of data type. Those key data types are:

- Strings - To define a string include the key + the string in quotes
- Numbers - To define a number include the key + number not in quotes
- Booleans - To define 
- None - To define 
- Arrays - To define an array, it is enclosed in `[` brackets `]`.
- Another object - To define an object, it is enclosed in `{` braces `}`.

The notation is that all keys are enclosed in `""` like such `"name"`

EXAMPLE:
```json
{
   "name": "Jarron",
   "age": 29,
   "height": 5.8,
   "weight": 158,
   "schools": [ "Great Oak Highschool","California State University, Fullerton" ],
   "hasBachelors": true
}
```
