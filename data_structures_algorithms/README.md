## Algorithm

What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of instructions to finish a task.

Algorithm has a clear problem statement.

These are main questions that should be asked when performing an algorithm:
- What is the problem statement?
- What is the input? 
- What is the output?

Requirements:
- The steps of the algorithm need to be in a specific order
- The steps also need to be distinct
- The algorithm should product a results
- The algorithm should complete in a finite of time

To evaluation an algorithm the:
- Correctness
- Efficency
```
+-------+    +---------+    +--------+
| input | -> | problem | -> | output |
+-------+    +---------+    +--------+
```

Correctness:
- An algorithm is deemed correct if all possible inputs give the expected output
- For every possible input the algorithm MUST always terminate

Efficency:
- Time complexity measure of how long the algorithm runs
- Space complexity the amount of memory that is taken up in the computer

Linear search - checks each value sequentially
- Does not need to be sorted 
- Input = list of values
- Output = target value

Binary Search - compares value in the middle to 
- Has to be sorted 
- Input sorted list of values
- Output position of the list of the target value we searching for

Big O Notation - theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size

O(n) 
- O - ordor of magnitute of complexity
- n -
