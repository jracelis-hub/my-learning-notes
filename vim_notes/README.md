## ***Introduction***

***What is VIM***

Vim or (Vi IMproved) is a power text editor which is an improved version of Vi (Visual Editor).

* When you use `:` that is calling a command within ***vim***.
* When you used `:!` then you are calling a command within the terminal.

Example
```
vim file.txt
:!ls
# This will list the files within current directory as if you did it on the command line
```
